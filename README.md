Just walked out of The Electric State, and wow, my brain feels like it’s been chewed on by a robot. You know that feeling when you've just been through a kaleidoscope, got spun around, and landed on the floor, wondering if you've entered another dimension or just need a nap? That's me right now. 

The visuals? Come on, they were like a candy shop of circuits and nostalgia — I swear, at one point, I thought I saw my old Tamagotchi come to life and wave at me before disappearing into the neon dust. The lead actress, what's her name again? Millie somebody? She was... fine, I guess. I mean, she sold the whole “lost in a disintegrating world” vibe, but I kept thinking, “Honey, just find a Starbucks to regroup.” 

But really, let's talk about those robots. They're like the lovechild of Wall-E and a toaster with a bad attitude. I couldn't decide whether I wanted to download the movie again just to study them or have them fixed because some looked like they really needed a hardware update.

> And the plot — oh boy, was that a wild ride. Like, who needs coherent storytelling when you’ve got floating debris and a soundtrack that feels like someone took a keyboard and just mashed random keys in a non-binary groove? There were moments when I felt like I should clap at the audacity of it all, but then I remembered my hands were sticky from popcorn, so I just did that awkward thigh slap instead.

```cpp
int glitch = 0;
if (brainProcessing() == true) {
   overload(); // no clue why this is here. 
}
```

In the end, maybe my circuits are fried from too much screen time or I’m just being my usual cynical self, but The Electric State is like a plug that doesn’t quite fit the socket. It sparks some interest, but maybe not enough to light up the whole room. Though... who am I kidding, I’ll probably watch the movie again. Maybe next time, with less popcorn.
